# metacpan-cpan-extracted-lite

**Please:** do not delete this repository, this is useful for developing.

This repository is a smaller & frozen version of [metacpan-cpan-extracted](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-cpan-extracted).

The goal is to be able to develop without cloning the original repo.

The original repository requires several GB of disk space.
Cloning such a large repo can be very inconvenient & slow on a development server.

Thanks.
