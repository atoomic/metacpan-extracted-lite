Mojolicious::Plugin::AutoReload

This plugin automatically reloades the page when the Mojolicious webapp
restarts. This is especially useful when using the Morbo development
server
<http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides/Tutorial#Reloading>,
which automatically restarts the webapp when it detects changes.
Combined, "morbo" and "Mojolicious::Plugin::AutoReload" will
automatically display your new content whenever you change your webapp
in your editor!

This works by opening a WebSocket connection to a specific Mojolicious
route. When the server restarts, the WebSocket is disconnected, which
triggers a reload of the page.
