NAME

    Mojo::Reactor::Epoll - epoll backend for Mojo::Reactor

SYNOPSIS

      use Mojo::Reactor::Epoll;
    
      # Watch if handle becomes readable or writable
      my $reactor = Mojo::Reactor::Epoll->new;
      $reactor->io($first => sub {
        my ($reactor, $writable) = @_;
        say $writable ? 'First handle is writable' : 'First handle is readable';
      });
    
      # Change to watching only if handle becomes writable
      $reactor->watch($first, 0, 1);
    
      # Turn file descriptor into handle and watch if it becomes readable
      my $second = IO::Handle->new_from_fd($fd, 'r');
      $reactor->io($second => sub {
        my ($reactor, $writable) = @_;
        say $writable ? 'Second handle is writable' : 'Second handle is readable';
      })->watch($second, 1, 0);
    
      # Add a timer
      $reactor->timer(15 => sub {
        my $reactor = shift;
        $reactor->remove($first);
        $reactor->remove($second);
        say 'Timeout!';
      });
    
      # Start reactor if necessary
      $reactor->start unless $reactor->is_running;
    
      # Or in an application using Mojo::IOLoop
      use Mojo::Reactor::Epoll;
      use Mojo::IOLoop;
      
      # Or in a Mojolicious application
      $ MOJO_REACTOR=Mojo::Reactor::Epoll hypnotoad script/myapp

DESCRIPTION

    Mojo::Reactor::Epoll is an event reactor for Mojo::IOLoop that uses the
    epoll(7) Linux subsystem. The usage is exactly the same as other
    Mojo::Reactor implementations such as Mojo::Reactor::Poll.
    Mojo::Reactor::Epoll will be used as the default backend for
    Mojo::IOLoop if it is loaded before Mojo::IOLoop or any module using
    the loop. However, when invoking a Mojolicious application through
    morbo or hypnotoad, the reactor must be set as the default by setting
    the MOJO_REACTOR environment variable to Mojo::Reactor::Epoll.

EVENTS

    Mojo::Reactor::Epoll inherits all events from Mojo::Reactor.

METHODS

    Mojo::Reactor::Epoll inherits all methods from Mojo::Reactor and
    implements the following new ones.

 again

      $reactor->again($id);

    Restart timer. Note that this method requires an active timer.

 io

      $reactor = $reactor->io($handle => sub {...});

    Watch handle for I/O events, invoking the callback whenever handle
    becomes readable or writable.

      # Callback will be invoked twice if handle becomes readable and writable
      $reactor->io($handle => sub {
        my ($reactor, $writable) = @_;
        say $writable ? 'Handle is writable' : 'Handle is readable';
      });

 is_running

      my $bool = $reactor->is_running;

    Check if reactor is running.

 next_tick

      my $undef = $reactor->next_tick(sub {...});

    Invoke callback as soon as possible, but not before returning or other
    callbacks that have been registered with this method, always returns
    undef.

 one_tick

      $reactor->one_tick;

    Run reactor until an event occurs or no events are being watched
    anymore. Note that this method can recurse back into the reactor, so
    you need to be careful.

      # Don't block longer than 0.5 seconds
      my $id = $reactor->timer(0.5 => sub {});
      $reactor->one_tick;
      $reactor->remove($id);

 recurring

      my $id = $reactor->recurring(0.25 => sub {...});

    Create a new recurring timer, invoking the callback repeatedly after a
    given amount of time in seconds.

 remove

      my $bool = $reactor->remove($handle);
      my $bool = $reactor->remove($id);

    Remove handle or timer.

 reset

      $reactor->reset;

    Remove all handles and timers.

 start

      $reactor->start;

    Start watching for I/O and timer events, this will block until "stop"
    is called or no events are being watched anymore.

      # Start reactor only if it is not running already
      $reactor->start unless $reactor->is_running;

 stop

      $reactor->stop;

    Stop watching for I/O and timer events.

 timer

      my $id = $reactor->timer(0.5 => sub {...});

    Create a new timer, invoking the callback after a given amount of time
    in seconds.

 watch

      $reactor = $reactor->watch($handle, $readable, $writable);

    Change I/O events to watch handle for with true and false values. Note
    that this method requires an active I/O watcher.

      # Watch only for readable events
      $reactor->watch($handle, 1, 0);
    
      # Watch only for writable events
      $reactor->watch($handle, 0, 1);
    
      # Watch for readable and writable events
      $reactor->watch($handle, 1, 1);
    
      # Pause watching for events
      $reactor->watch($handle, 0, 0);
