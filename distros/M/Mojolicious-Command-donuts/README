NAME

    Mojolicious::Command::donuts - Find fresh donuts with Mojolicious!

SYNOPSIS

        $ mojo donuts --geo 34.14,-118.40 --fresh
        $ mojo donuts --raw
        $ mojo donuts

DESCRIPTION

    Mojolicious::Command::donuts currently only fetches results from
    KrispyKreme. If geo is not specified, this module tries to geocode your
    IP and use that for searching.

    The fresh option filters results by stores which have their "Hotlight"
    on. This means fresh donuts.

    The raw option prints out the raw data structure returned from the site
    (currently KripsyKreme). If --raw is not enabled, The store's address
    is printed out along with any Hotlight indicator.

TODO

    This module was written with the intent of supporting more than one
    donuts site - e.g. Yum Yum and Dunkin Donuts. Unfortunately, those
    sites make it a bit more difficult to scrape results. However, patches
    are welcome!
