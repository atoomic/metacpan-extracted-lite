NAME

    Mojo::Unicode::UTF8 - use Unicode::UTF8 as the UTF-8 encoder for
    Mojolicious

SYNOPSIS

     use Mojo::Unicode::UTF8;
     use Mojo::Util 'decode', 'encode';
     
     # Preload for scripts using Mojo::Util
     $ perl -MMojo::Unicode::UTF8 $(which morbo) myapp.pl
     
     # Must be set in environment for hypnotoad
     $ PERL5OPT=-MMojo::Unicode::UTF8 hypnotoad myapp.pl

DESCRIPTION

    Mojo::Unicode::UTF8 is a monkey-patch module for using Unicode::UTF8 as
    the UTF-8 encoder for a Mojolicious application, or anything else using
    Mojo::Util. It must be loaded before Mojo::Util so the new functions
    will be properly exported. Calling "decode" in Mojo::Util or "encode"
    in Mojo::Util with any encoding other than UTF-8 will fall back to
    Encode as normal. For details on the benefits, see "COMPARISON" in
    Unicode::UTF8.
