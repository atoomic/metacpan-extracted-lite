NAME
    Mojo::Redis - DEPRECATED Redis client

DESCRIPTION
    Mojo::Redis is replaced by Mojo::Redis2.

    THIS MODULE IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED AND WILL BE REPLACED BY A COMPLETELY
    NEW API DURING 2015.

    The new API is available in Mojo::Redis2.

    Some time during 2015, this module will be completely replaced by the
    code from Mojo::Redis2.

    YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS MODULE. THE RISK OF MEMORY LEAKS AND MISSING OUT
    ON ERRORS IS INEVITABLE.

    The exact date for replacement is not yet set, but when it's replaced
    your existing Mojo::Redis code *will* break.

    REPLACE Mojo::Redis WITH Mojo::Redis2 NOW.

SUPPORT
    There's no support for this module.
